<h1 align="center">Authentica for n8n</h1>

<p align="center">
  Saudi identity & communications APIs for OTP and balance — packaged as an n8n Community Node.
</p>

---

## ✨ What’s included in v0.1.0

This first release focuses on the essentials:

* **Account → Get Balance**
* **OTP → Send** (SMS / WhatsApp / Email)
* **OTP → Verify**

> Face & Voice operations will ship in a later version. The UI only exposes the three endpoints above.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* n8n **v1.x** (self‑hosted or desktop)
* Node.js **>= 20** (for local development)
* An **Authentica API key** (header: `X-Authorization`)

---

## 🚀 Install

### Install from the n8n editor (Community Nodes)

1. Open the n8n editor → **Settings → Community Nodes → Install**.
2. Search for **Authentica** (package **`n8n-nodes-authentica`**).
3. Click **Install** and confirm the warning screen.
4. n8n downloads the package from npm and reloads. You’ll now see **Authentica** in the Nodes panel.

> If you don’t see “Community Nodes”, your admin needs to enable it for your instance. On n8n Cloud it’s available by default.

### Update / Uninstall

* **Update:** Settings → Community Nodes → find *Authentica* → **Update**.
* **Uninstall:** Settings → Community Nodes → find *Authentica* → **Uninstall**.

### Offline / Self‑hosted without Community Nodes

If Community Nodes is disabled in your environment, install via npm on the host that runs n8n and point the extensions path:

```bash
npm i n8n-nodes-authentica
export N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS="/absolute/path/to/node_modules/n8n-nodes-authentica"
n8n start
```

---

## 🔐 Credentials — *Authentica API*

Create a new credential in **Credentials → New → Authentica API**.

**Fields**

* **API Key** *(required)*: your Authentica key (sent as `X-Authorization`)
* **Base URL** *(optional)*: defaults to `https://api.authentica.sa`

**Test**

* Click **Test** to call `/api/v2/balance` — you should see **Success**.

---

## 🧩 Node usage

### 1) Account → Get Balance

* **Resource:** `Account`
* **Operation:** `Get Balance`
* **Output:** `{ balance: number, currency?: string, ... }`

### 2) OTP → Send

* **Resource:** `OTP`
* **Operation:** `Send`
* **Channel:** `SMS` | `WhatsApp` | `Email`
* **Phone** *(required for SMS/WhatsApp)*: **E.164** format, e.g. `+9665XXXXXXX`
* **Email** *(required for Email)*: valid email
* **Optional:** message/template fields as supported by your Authentica app

**Output (example)**

```json
{
  "status": "sent",
  "recipient": "+9665XXXXXXX",
  "channel": "sms",
  "requestId": "req_12345"
}
```

### 3) OTP → Verify

* **Resource:** `OTP`
* **Operation:** `Verify`
* **Verify With:** `Phone` or `Email`
* **Code:** the OTP the user received

**Output (example)**

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "recipient": "+9665XXXXXXX",
  "method": "phone"
}
```

> **Validation built‑in:**
>
> * Phone must be E.164 (`+<country><number>`). Example KSA mobile: `+9665…`
> * Email must be a well‑formed address.

---

## 🧪 Quick‑start workflows (JSON)

Exported examples to help you test fast:

* `examples/authentica-balance.json` — single node, get balance
* `examples/authentica-otp-send.json` — send OTP to phone/email
* `examples/authentica-otp-verify.json` — verify a received OTP code

> In the editor, **Import from file** and run. Make sure your **Authentica API** credential is configured.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

* **401 Unauthorized** → API key missing/invalid. Recheck the *Authentica API* credential, header `X-Authorization`.
* **422 Unprocessable Entity** → A required field is missing or invalid (e.g., non‑E.164 phone). Fix inputs and retry.
* **Rate limiting** → If you expect bursts, add a **Wait** or **Rate Limit** node before the Authentica node.
* **Large execution data** → Run with the top‑bar **Execute workflow** button, or enable on‑disk binaries.

---

## 📦 Build locally (contributors)

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
# local load
export N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS="$PWD"
n8n start
```

The build copies the SVG icon to `dist` so the node shows the Authentica logo inside the editor.

---

## 🔒 Security & privacy

* Keep API keys in **Credentials** (never hardcode in workflows).
* Use **E.164** phones and never log sensitive PII in plaintext nodes.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (next releases)

* Face/Voice enrollment & verification
* Webhooks for async outcomes (e.g., OTP delivery status)
* Additional SMS features (sender IDs, templates)

---

## 🙌 Thanks
